        <p>The lion, often called the "King of the Jungle," is a large feline native to Africa and parts of India. Lions live in social groups called prides, consisting of multiple females, their cubs, and a dominant male.</p>
        <p>They are known for their powerful roars, which can be heard up to 5 miles away. Lions are apex predators, meaning they are at the top of the food chain.</p>
